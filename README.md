# SoundboardMaker

Requires Java 11. Created by Sean Maxwell, Summer 2014/Nov 2018

<br>

**Overview:**
<br>
Thanks your for checking out SoundboardMaker. This is a Java desktop application for creating custom soundboards. It was 
my first personal project that I did while still a student in computer science. I initially created this project in the 
summer of 2014 with Java 7. Recently, I updated it to Java 11 4 years after I first created it. This isn't a complex 
full-fledged program meant to be used for actual production. It's just a small project that I used to teach myself Java.
I did not want it to die and I also wanted to play with Java 11, so I decided to revamp it and release it to the world.
Please star this repo if actually find this project useful.

## <a name="download"></a> Download

To download the program, please go to my website <a href='http://seanpmaxwell.com/projects'>seanpmaxwell.com/projects</a>
and notice the "Linux" and "Windows" buttons near the bottom for the SoundboardMaker. Download the appropriate .jar file 
for your Operating System.  

<br/>


## <a name="start-program"></a> Start Program

Once you have the jar downloaded, you'll need to use Java 11 to start it. If Java 11 is your default version go ahead
and start it:

`java -jar Soundboard_Maker.jar`

I developed the project on Linux for which Java 11 was not the default version. If you're on Linux and you don't want
to switch your default version you can download Java 11 and do:

`/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11/bin/java -jar Soundboard_Maker.jar`

## <a name="new-project"></a> New Project

You don't need to create a new project to start making sounds, but if you want to save your soundboard you need to have
it as part of a project. Don't create a bunch of buttons and then click "New Project". If you click "New Project" 
without saving first, it will erase all your buttons. So the first thing you should do is create a new project and then
add buttons to it. After you click "New Project", you will get a prompt asking you what to name it.

## <a name="add-sounds"></a> Add Sound Buttons

To add sounds to a soundboard, you need to create buttons to hold those sounds. To create a new button/sound, click the
"New Sound" button after creating a new project. You'll be prompted to enter a label, and a new button with the label
will appear on the right side of the window.
